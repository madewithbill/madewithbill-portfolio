As a purely informative site for outreach and fundraising during
their business focus shift, I developed a transitional layout and
visual system from scratch while working to meet the client's
current priorities. This includes a fully modular grid-based hero
graphic to highlight Detect's key messaging and value proposition.

The project features custom GSAP JavaScript alongside Webflow
interactions for subtle animation to support the existing brand and
storytelling approach. For continued maintenance, I implemented
Webflow's page slot and component structure, allowing the client to
manage specific content sections independently through Build mode.
