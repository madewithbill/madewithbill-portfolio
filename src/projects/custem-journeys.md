This was a full-scale project for which I visually rebranded the show while developing a definitive brand strategy tailored to its audience and future business partners. With this ecosystem in place, I then developed a bespoke treatment for the website in Webflow, along with a small collection of branded merchandise for an integrated Fourthwall shop. 

I also had the chance to flex my video editing and mograph skills to create a custom intro for the show on its YouTube channel.
