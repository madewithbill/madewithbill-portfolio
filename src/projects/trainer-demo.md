A demo project for a personal trainer, designed in Figma and developed in Webflow. 

Here, I'm using Finsweet's Client-First styling framework. I experimented
with Relume's AI tools to ideate on the sitemap and wireframe the initial layout, but
transitioned to a "from-scratch" build in Webflow for greater component control
and simpler structures with less nesting.

This project currently exists as an ongoing playground of sorts as I test out Webflow's newest features – like the GSAP timeline – and custom code solutions such as CSS animations to extend functionality beyond the platform's built-in feature set.
