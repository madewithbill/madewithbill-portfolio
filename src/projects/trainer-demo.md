Homepage demo designed in Figma and built in Webflow, using
Finsweet's Client-First styling framework. I initially experimented
with Relume to iterate on the sitemap and wireframe before
transitioning to a from-scratch build in Webflow for greater control
and a structure with less nesting. I also used custom code alongside
the Swiper JavaScript library for additional design elements and
functionality beyond Webflow's built-in feature set.
