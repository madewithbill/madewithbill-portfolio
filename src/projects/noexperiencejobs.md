As a job board and recruiting platform, the Nex brand is a balancing
act designed specifically to capture new entries into the workforce
and established employers looking for a curated talent search
experience.

Beyond the design work, I integrated user authentication, content
gating, and a job posting credits system for the Webflow project
using a stack of Memberstack, Make, and Stripe. I also supported
accessible integrations with marketing platforms including beehiiv.

The project utilizes Finsweet's Client-First framework for
consistent utility formatting, plus custom code for improved content
security and user-led actions. Launched in November 2024, the
platform has amassed 8,000+ users as of June 2025.
