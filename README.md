## Learnings
* Really love the ease with with you can stand up components without diving deeps on frameworks like React. It's been nice to come across an approachable, but sustainable way to build out a large set of pages.
* Content Collections were admittedly a pain to get up and running, but once I got comfortable with its concepts, nuances, and file structure, I'm pretty happy with the inital result. This is not a content heavy site, but the ability to manage things from single source of truth in a simple markdown file is such a value add. Plus I can see how getting involved with schema decisions and site-wide consideratiosn for collections will translate over to my continued Webflow work.

## Next Steps
* I'll look to get some practice with GSAP in a traditional code enviroment. Partiulary interested to figure out best practice for how to implement JS with a framework that stresses html/css builds out of the box.
* Also want to integrate adittional baseline features as the need arises (i.e. forms, mobile nav)
