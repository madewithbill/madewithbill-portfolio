            Over the years, Iâ€™ve designed consumer products, promoted electric
            vehicles, and launched refreshed brands. The constant driver through
            it all has been a constant curiosity to build.

            Currently, I focus most of my time on Webflow development, with a
            growing skill set to deliver dynamic user experiences, including a
            few fun projects in the pipeline.
